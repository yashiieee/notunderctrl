 <summary><h3>💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I got into coding in 2020, when Discord released the verified bot developer badge. I was intrigued by the idea of creating my own custom bot for the platform, so I decided to give it a try. I had no prior experience in coding, but I thought I might as well give it a shot.
<br>
<br>
I dove headfirst into Node.js and began working on my first discord bot. I encountered many challenges along the way since it was my first time coding, but I eventually got my bot up and running with some 10-15 commands. With the help of a few online friends I managed to get my bot added in a decent number of servers. However, just as I was about to apply for the verified bot developer badge, Discord removed the option altogether.
<br>
<br>
Despite this setback, I was still fascinated by the idea of creating my own web applications. I began to explore other areas of web development, and soon discovered the world of front-end web development. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and began recreating webpages.
<br>
<br>
As my skills and knowledge grew, I started to delve deeper into web development, and eventually began building full-stack web applications. I found coding to be challenging, but also extremely rewarding. I loved the feeling of creating something from scratch, and watching it come to life.
<br>
<br>
I continue to work on my coding skills, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my work on Github, and I hope to inspire others to explore the world of coding as well.
